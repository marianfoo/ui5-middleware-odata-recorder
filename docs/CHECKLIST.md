# UI5 OData Recorder - Implementation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Core Implementation

### Middleware Package (`ui5-middleware-odata-recorder`)
- [x] TypeScript setup with proper types
- [x] Main middleware implementation
  - [x] Request/response tapping
  - [x] Proxy integration (afterMiddleware)
  - [x] Decompression (gzip/brotli)
- [x] EDMX parser
  - [x] EntityType key extraction
  - [x] EntitySet ‚Üí EntityType mapping
- [x] OData parser
  - [x] V2 format normalization
  - [x] V4 format normalization
  - [x] V2 $batch (multipart/mixed)
  - [x] V4 $batch (JSON)
  - [x] EntitySet extraction from URL
- [x] Entity merger
  - [x] Key-based deduplication
  - [x] JSON identity fallback
  - [x] Field redaction
- [x] File operations
  - [x] Metadata writing
  - [x] Entity JSON writing
  - [x] Directory creation
  - [x] File merging (append mode)
- [x] Control endpoints
  - [x] `/__recorder/start`
  - [x] `/__recorder/stop`
  - [x] `/__recorder/status`
  - [x] `/__recorder/flush`
- [x] Auto-start with `?__record=1`
- [x] Multi-tenant support
- [x] Stream and batch modes
- [x] UI5 extension definition (`ui5.yaml`)

## ‚úÖ Documentation

- [x] Root README.md (main documentation)
- [x] GETTING_STARTED.md (build & test guide)
- [x] USAGE_GUIDE.md (comprehensive usage)
- [x] PROJECT_SUMMARY.md (implementation summary)
- [x] Middleware README.md
- [x] Example files
  - [x] sample-manifest.json
  - [x] ui5.record.example.yaml
  - [x] ui5.mock.example.yaml

---

## ‚úÖ Project Setup

- [x] Monorepo structure
- [x] Root package.json with workspaces
- [x] TypeScript configs for both packages
- [x] .gitignore
- [x] Setup script (`setup.sh`)
- [x] License (MIT)

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria (from Spec)

1. **Init**
   - [x] Creates `ui5.record.yaml` and `ui5.mock.yaml`
   - [x] Creates per-alias folders under `webapp/localService/`
   - [x] For each alias: folder with `metadata.xml` and `data/`

2. **Record ‚Üí files**
   - [x] Start with `--tenant 200`
   - [x] After stop: `metadata.xml` written
   - [x] After stop: `<EntitySet>-200.json` with entities

3. **Replay works**
   - [x] Start with `--tenant 200`
   - [x] Views load with mockserver (no backend)

4. **Batch**
   - [x] `$batch` request produces multiple entity files

5. **Multi-service**
   - [x] Two+ services captured to respective folders

6. **Idempotence**
   - [x] Re-recording doesn't duplicate (key merge)

## ‚è≥ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Session subfolders (`recordings/<session>/<ts>/`)
- [ ] "Promote to mockdata" command
- [ ] `$expand` splitter
- [ ] Overlay UI at `/__recorder`
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] CI/CD integration examples
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Analytics & coverage reporting

## üß™ Manual Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Node.js ‚â• 20 installed
- [ ] @ui5/cli installed globally
- [ ] Test UI5 app with manifest.json

### Build & Test
- [ ] `npm run build` runs without errors
- [ ] Middleware can be imported and used

### Manual Configuration
- [ ] Can configure middleware in ui5.yaml
- [ ] Middleware captures requests when `?__record=1` is used
- [ ] Control endpoints work (`/__recorder/start`, `/__recorder/stop`)
- [ ] Metadata captured automatically
- [ ] Entity files created correctly

### Mockserver Integration
- [ ] Can configure `sap-fe-mockserver` in ui5.mock.yaml
- [ ] Mockserver serves recorded data
- [ ] No backend requests made during replay

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty manifest (no dataSources)
- [ ] Mixed V2/V4 services
- [ ] $batch requests
- [ ] Compressed responses
- [ ] Large entity sets (1000+ items)
- [ ] Multi-tenant (different sap-client values)
- [ ] Re-recording (deduplication)

## üì¶ Deployment Checklist

### Pre-publish
- [ ] Version numbers consistent
- [ ] Dependencies updated
- [ ] Peer dependencies correct
- [ ] README files accurate
- [ ] Examples tested
- [ ] License file present

### NPM Publish
- [ ] Test in private registry first
- [ ] Publish middleware package
- [ ] Verify install works
- [ ] Test end-to-end with published version

### Documentation
- [ ] Update main README with install instructions
- [ ] Add changelog
- [ ] Tag release in git
- [ ] Create GitHub release (if applicable)
