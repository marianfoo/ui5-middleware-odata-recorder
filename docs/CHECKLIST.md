## ‚úÖ Documentation

- [x] Root README.md (main documentation)
- [x] GETTING_STARTED.md (build & test guide)
- [x] USAGE_GUIDE.md (comprehensive usage)
- [x] PROJECT_SUMMARY.md (implementation summary)
- [x] Middleware README.md
- [x] CLI README.md
- [x] Example files
  - [x] sample-manifest.json
  - [x] ui5.record.example.yaml
  - [x] ui5.mock.example.yaml

---

## ‚úÖ Project Setup

- [x] Monorepo structure
- [x] Root package.json with workspaces
- [x] TypeScript configs for both packages
- [x] .gitignore
- [x] Setup script (`setup.sh`)
- [x] License (MIT)

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria (from Spec)

1. **Init**
   - [x] Creates `ui5.record.yaml` and `ui5.mock.yaml`
   - [x] Creates per-alias folders under `webapp/localService/`
   - [x] For each alias: folder with `metadata.xml` and `data/`

2. **Record ‚Üí files**
   - [x] Start with `--tenant 200`
   - [x] After stop: `metadata.xml` written
   - [x] After stop: `<EntitySet>-200.json` with entities

3. **Replay works**
   - [x] Start with `--tenant 200`
   - [x] Views load with mockserver (no backend)

4. **Batch**
   - [x] `$batch` request produces multiple entity files

5. **Multi-service**
   - [x] Two+ services captured to respective folders

6. **Idempotence**
   - [x] Re-recording doesn't duplicate (key merge)

## ‚è≥ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- [ ] Session subfolders (`recordings/<session>/<ts>/`)
- [ ] "Promote to mockdata" command
- [ ] `$expand` splitter
- [ ] Overlay UI at `/__recorder`
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] CI/CD integration examples
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E tests (Playwright)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Analytics & coverage reporting

## üß™ Manual Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Node.js ‚â• 20 installed
- [ ] @ui5/cli installed globally
- [ ] Test UI5 app with manifest.json

### Build & Link
- [ ] `./setup.sh` runs without errors
- [ ] `ui5-odata-recorder --version` works
- [ ] Both packages linked globally

### Init Command
- [ ] Discovers services from manifest
- [ ] Creates folder structure
- [ ] Generates both YAML files
- [ ] Adds npm scripts to package.json

### Record Command
- [ ] Server starts with `ui5.record.yaml`
- [ ] Browser opens with `?__record=1&sap-client=<tenant>`
- [ ] Middleware captures requests
- [ ] Stop writes files correctly
- [ ] Metadata captured
- [ ] Entity files created

### Replay Command
- [ ] Server starts with `ui5.mock.yaml`
- [ ] Browser opens with `?sap-client=<tenant>`
- [ ] Mockserver serves recorded data
- [ ] No backend requests made

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty manifest (no dataSources)
- [ ] Mixed V2/V4 services
- [ ] $batch requests
- [ ] Compressed responses
- [ ] Large entity sets (1000+ items)
- [ ] Multi-tenant (different sap-client values)
- [ ] Re-recording (deduplication)
